Working as a Dell Brand Ambassador, one of my main duties is to fill out a recap form on Brandscopic.com. It's a great web-based form that captures my comments, hours worked and pictures of the event. The primary colors used throughout the website are red, grey and white.

<h1>UBER</h1>
<p>Uber has become one of the most popular names in California. It began with simple a simple idea of allowing anyone to become a driver and has enhanced it's User Experience throughout the years. To start with, you open the app and pick your location. Once you request a ride, you're able to view the 'fare estimate', which helps give the rider an idea of what they'll be spending. For new users, UBER offers numerous codes like the one shown in the picture below. If you're taking a trip with multiple people, UBER created 'split fare' which breaks down the numerics. Once you're done, you rate your driver and they rate you. It's all pretty simple really and it allows you to share an experience with someone like you!   </p>
