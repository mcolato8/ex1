    <h1>Capturing User Experience</h1>  
    <h2>through color</h2>
    <h3>January 28,2016</h3>

   <img id = "img" src="../images/ex3.png" style="width:650px;height:350px;">
<p>While working on this exercise, I thought about the most important design attributes that continue to catch my attention. A few of the attributes include hierarchy, color, and shapes. Although I wasn't able to bring in too many shapes into my design, I used hierarchy and color to emphasize the importance of each section. Once the user hover's over each time-slot, a message is shown and that specific time changes color. It definitely makes it for a friendly user experience. </p>

    
    <h1>Critical Evaluation</h1>

Working as a Dell Brand Ambassador, one of my main duties is to fill out a recap form on Brandscopic.com. It's a great web-based form that recaps of events I've worked through my comments, hours worked and pictures of events.

    Unfortunately, the marketing company I work for has yet to link this web-based form to their payroll database and requires me to go onto another dreadful portal. 
    <br>
When entering the website, the user is welcomed with a lot of<span style= "color:red"> red</span>. According to Bill Derouchey's slideshow, this would be alarming to the  user but it's actually rather soother. 
    Throughout the website, only a little bit of red and blue are used to indicate certain events while black, grey and white dominate the page. There's a bar on the side of the page to indicate the user where they are on the site and where they can go. This reminds me of the "on air" example that's shown in the slideshow. 
    <br> 
I believe this web-based form does its job of capturing what it needs with the right tools.

<h1>UBER</h1>
    <h3>January 12,2016</h3>
    
<img id ="img" src="../images/uber.jpg" style="width:300px;height:150px;">
<p>Uber has become one of the most popular names in California. It began with simple a simple idea of allowing anyone to become a driver and has enhanced it's User Experience throughout the years. To start with, you open the app and pick your location. Once you request a ride, you're able to view the 'fare estimate', which helps give the rider an idea of what they'll be spending. For new users, UBER offers numerous codes like the one shown in the picture below. If you're taking a trip with multiple people, UBER created 'split fare' which breaks down the numerics. Once you're done, you rate your driver and they rate you. It's all pretty simple really and it allows you to share an experience with someone like you!   </p>
